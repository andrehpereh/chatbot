Is that something we can do in wattworks?
4/12/23, 11:26 PM - Ilse Flatmate: There are different tables in order to see which size of bike you need according to your height etc, so if you know more or less and then ask Erich on Saturday (if you’re going to a bike class) to double check I think you’re good :)

4/20/23, 9:51 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Doesn’t sounds very emphatic
4/20/23, 9:51 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Like she wants to figure it out but after this is all done that she’s over it
4/20/23, 9:51 PM - Ilse Flatmate: At least that’s the impression I get

4/21/23, 3:06 PM - Andres Perez: We can talk it through, but to make my actions coherent with my emotions, I think it would be better if you find a place to stay starting from Sunday onwards.
4/21/23, 3:09 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yeah sounds fair

5/4/23, 9:05 PM - Ilse Flatmate: You can take some of the rice on the stove that I made tonight, I think that works better than a pizza if you’re not feeling well
5/4/23, 9:05 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Just take as much as you like
5/4/23, 9:05 PM - Ilse Flatmate: A pizza is way too greasy in my opinion

5/29/23, 1:58 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Alrightt
5/30/23, 12:47 PM - Ilse Flatmate: When do you want to get groceries?
5/30/23, 1:59 PM - Andres Perez: Just finished
5/30/23, 1:59 PM - Andres Perez: See you there in 5 mins?
5/30/23, 2:00 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yess cool
6/2/23, 8:06 AM - Andres Perez: Are you awake by any chance? 🫣🥹
6/2/23, 8:07 AM - Andres Perez: No worries, for a moment I thought I forgot my keys, but I have them with me :)
6/2/23, 9:29 AM - Ilse Flatmate: Glad you have them😅☺️
6/2/23, 11:31 PM - Andres Perez: Holaaaa
6/2/23, 11:32 PM - Andres Perez: Quick question, tomorrow I am going to Hoorn again to do the route
6/2/23, 11:34 PM - Andres Perez: And after that I have to go for a run right after the bike, but I am a bit afraid about leaving my bike alone haha specially because I don't have a lock.
Do you think I could leave it for around 30 mins at Storms place while I go for my run? Just something that came to my mind.
6/2/23, 11:34 PM - Andres Perez: Of course if it is a bit of struggle I can come back and run here
6/2/23, 11:35 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Holaaa
6/2/23, 11:36 PM - Ilse Flatmate: It’s a good idea, however Storm’s place is not close enough to the Iron Man route, also nobody’s going to be home at his place so you can’t keep it inside
6/2/23, 11:36 PM - Andres Perez: Oki, no worries then :) I'll do the run when I get back
6/2/23, 11:37 PM - Andres Perez: Well, i am going to sleep cause it's gonna be a long day
6/2/23, 11:37 PM - Andres Perez: Good night! 🙃😁

https://betaalverzoek.rabobank.nl/betaalverzoek/?id=_Nopk3BwTZOL43rJcjknoQ
6/19/23, 5:06 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Seriously not planned
6/19/23, 5:07 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
6/19/23, 5:07 PM - Andres Perez: I'll try again in a bit :)
6/19/23, 5:07 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yeah no worries
6/20/23, 10:00 AM - Ilse Flatmate: Is it working now? :)
6/20/23, 10:04 AM - Andres Perez: Yes
6/20/23, 10:04 AM - Andres Perez: Paid
6/20/23, 4:04 PM - Ilse Flatmate: I'm thinking of trying to discuss with Marijn tomorrow that maybe Lobke can be here less often, what do you think?
6/20/23, 4:09 PM - Andres Perez: Let's do it the day after if she stays one more night, it would be more notable how often she is here
6/20/23, 4:09 PM - Andres Perez: I just saw your response haha
6/20/23, 4:10 PM - Ilse Flatmate: That’s a good one
6/20/23, 4:10 PM - Ilse Flatmate: I want to ask it in a subtle way but I find it difficult to do so😂
6/20/23, 4:11 PM - Andres Perez: I got it haha
6/20/23, 4:16 PM - Andres Perez: Btw, I put some money aside for my investments at the beginning of each month, hence I have no much money left until the 25th. I could pay the taxes, but I am not sure if I'll have to buy anything last minute before the ironman. So, I'll pay it once I get my salary and I'll cover the extra cost that that might cause
6/20/23, 4:17 PM - Ilse Flatmate: No it's fine, I will pay the bill and you just pay my tikkie whenever you can miss the money :)
6/21/23, 9:48 AM - Ilse Flatmate: Holaa are you home this saturday around 11? A guy wants to come over to fix the bathroom
6/21/23, 9:48 AM - Andres Perez: Holaaa

6/22/23, 5:31 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Holaa
6/22/23, 5:31 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Today is the ftp test again
6/22/23, 5:31 PM - Ilse Flatmate: So if you’ve had enough rest before, then yes you can try it but I would advise the clevercycling one lol
6/22/23, 5:32 PM - Andres Perez: Is that the race at the end?
6/22/23, 5:32 PM - Andres Perez: I'll do the clever one then
6/22/23, 5:32 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Cool :)
6/22/23, 5:32 PM - Ilse Flatmate: No it’s to determine your ftp score on your bike
6/22/23, 5:32 PM - Ilse Flatmate: I’ll explain later hahah
6/22/23, 5:33 PM - Andres Perez: I don't think I have done it 😆
6/22/23, 5:33 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yeah but now you need to rest for your race so it’s not the best idea lol
6/22/23, 5:33 PM - Andres Perez: Indeed
6/22/23, 5:33 PM - Andres Perez: Next time then
6/22/23, 5:33 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Definitely :)
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Andres Perez: I am curious which is my score
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Ilse Flatmate: If you have time in the weekends we can always do it
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Or now every first week in the month there is a special moment for it
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Andres Perez: But the weekend is my race hah
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Ilse Flatmate: It’s also in the schedule
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yeah but maybe in a week or 2/3
6/22/23, 5:34 PM - Andres Perez: Oh, i see

6/24/23, 10:16 AM - Andres Perez: Were you drunk? 😂
6/24/23, 10:17 AM - Ilse Flatmate: I was fairly tipsy yes
6/24/23, 10:18 AM - Andres Perez: Haha nice! 💪🏾🙌🏾

6/24/23, 12:49 PM - Ilse Flatmate: I am going to try! Because I don’t know when you’re going to finish and I want to time it right :)
6/24/23, 6:02 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Is it maybe a good idea that I take you home with me tomorrow after your race with your bike by car?
6/24/23, 6:44 PM - Andres Perez: Holaaa, that sounds like a good idea. Although a few friends will come, we might stay there for a bit. Not sure yet 😕
6/24/23, 7:15 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Okay no worries! Wasn’t sure if your friends were also coming
6/24/23, 7:15 PM - Ilse Flatmate: But then nevermind :)

6/24/23, 11:55 PM - Ilse Flatmate: I’ll explain things better later

6/25/23, 6:55 PM - Andres Perez: I'll rest a bit and have some food and maybe we can have a tea after?
6/25/23, 9:12 PM - Andres Perez: Can I borrow you aloe vera again?
6/25/23, 9:18 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Yess but I don’t know where it is😂

6/25/23, 9:18 PM - Ilse Flatmate: Green jar
6/25/23, 9:19 PM - Andres Perez: Thanks
6/26/23, 11:46 AM - Ilse Flatmate: Holaa, just a reminder when it’s possible, can you pay the tikkie from the taxes? :)
