10/28/22, 6:18 PM - Anki: Y no me recuerdo el nombre de bebida que es más o menos como tequila 😅
10/28/22, 7:12 PM - Andres Perez: I am doing good, last night I compensated and slept 10 hours 😅 how about you?
10/28/22, 7:12 PM - Andres Perez: I'll give it a shot this weekend and let you know what I think after
10/28/22, 7:13 PM - Andres Perez: Not really, I was studying the basics this time, I forgot a few important things
10/28/22, 7:13 PM - Andres Perez: 😂 Se llama mezcal, it soo good
10/28/22, 7:13 PM - Andres Perez: When will it work for you?

10/30/22, 8:14 PM - Anki: Hola! Como estas?
10/30/22, 8:15 PM - Anki: Im afraid not haha, i can only write poetry in my own language
10/30/22, 8:17 PM - Anki: So nice!! I wanted to go home on time, but it was too much fun, so I stayed till the end. After a few hours sleep I had to played soccer and after that help my roommate move and then I went to the concert. And today I had to play a match as well, so my legs are very tired now haha
10/30/22, 8:18 PM - Anki: How was your match today?
10/30/22, 8:19 PM - Anki: And have you listened to the line? :)
10/30/22, 8:32 PM - Andres Perez: Hola bonita!
10/30/22, 8:32 PM - Andres Perez: Writing poetry seems already difficult in a native language haha so, It makes sense
10/30/22, 8:35 PM - Andres Perez: Sounds fun! You had a fun weekend. I am surprised you are still away, I'd be sleeping after a weekend like that. 😅 Which concert was it?
10/30/22, 8:37 PM - Andres Perez: It was okayish. We won but suffered a lot in the second half, but is also nice going to play and spend some time with the team regardless of the result.
10/30/22, 8:38 PM - Andres Perez: How were your matches? Did you score 5 goals?
10/30/22, 8:39 PM - Andres Perez: Indeed, I started, It's interesting, I'll continue tomorrow.
10/30/22, 8:42 PM - Andres Perez: At some point, the narrator proposed a study about motorcycles and the personalities of the riders because a lot of these soldiers ride them. And I was thinking in buying a motorcycle haha
10/30/22, 8:43 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
10/30/22, 8:43 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
10/30/22, 10:39 PM - Anki: Fast De, it’s a band of the boyfriend of a good friend.
10/30/22, 10:40 PM - Anki: Hahaha it might also be that having a motorcycle changes you, fun to find out;)
10/30/22, 10:42 PM - Anki: Looks nice, quite some people as well!
10/30/22, 10:42 PM - Anki: Haha good outfit! What was peculiar about it?
10/30/22, 10:42 PM - Anki: I’m going to sleep! Welterusten!
10/30/22, 11:06 PM - Andres Perez: Ah sí, how was it?
10/30/22, 11:07 PM - Andres Perez: That's a interesting proposal that I'd be willing to explore
10/30/22, 11:08 PM - Andres Perez: Thanks, well it was a Dutch - Mexican celebration of día de los muertos, so really different that I am used to
10/30/22, 11:08 PM - Andres Perez: How was your matches?
10/30/22, 11:09 PM - Andres Perez: Welterusten! Buenas noches 😴🫂😘
10/31/22, 10:28 AM - Anki: Really nice, such good musicans. It’s more experimental music, so surprising but also difficult to dance to at times since rhythm was changing all the time
10/31/22, 10:29 AM - Anki: Did you like it anyhow or not that much?
10/31/22, 10:30 AM - Anki: Oh Saturday we won 6-1, was an easy match and yesterday we lost with 2-1, but was fun as well. And tonight I have practice, but I think my legs will refuse 😂
10/31/22, 10:31 AM - Anki: What you’re doing on Thursday during daytime?
10/31/22, 11:53 AM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
10/31/22, 11:54 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah, I did enjoy it, also that seeing foreign people enjoying that tradition
10/31/22, 12:00 PM - Andres Perez: Well,  they will thank you in a few years 💪🏽
10/31/22, 12:00 PM - Andres Perez: Hmm I was planning to study, but I guess now I'll spend some time with you?
10/31/22, 1:43 PM - Anki: Yess, I thought I could come to Haarlem? Or we could go to the beach or anything?
10/31/22, 2:39 PM - Andres Perez: Indeed, that would be nice. I just checked the weather, and it might rain. So, better if we stay in Haarlem this time in case it rains? :)
10/31/22, 2:39 PM - Andres Perez: Have you been to Haarlem?
10/31/22, 4:50 PM - Anki: Or we can decide on Thurday? Then we know better about the weather:)
10/31/22, 4:50 PM - Anki: Yes several times, but can't say i know the city in and out
10/31/22, 5:10 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, that makes more sense 😅 we could meet at the station and the decide what to do
10/31/22, 5:10 PM - Andres Perez: What time are you thinking?
10/31/22, 5:10 PM - Andres Perez: I know some hidden nice spots :)
10/31/22, 5:15 PM - Anki: Sounds good
10/31/22, 5:15 PM - Anki: Around 14?
10/31/22, 5:15 PM - Anki: 😍😍
10/31/22, 5:20 PM - Andres Perez: Cool, that works!
10/31/22, 5:20 PM - Andres Perez: How is your day going? Hope you are having a good one ☺️
10/31/22, 6:19 PM - Anki: Nice
10/31/22, 6:19 PM - Anki: Yeah, I did a lot of cleaning and deciding things to stay sell or throw away, meanwhile listened to podcasts, so was quite nice. Some time for myself
10/31/22, 6:19 PM - Anki: What about you?
10/31/22, 7:30 PM - Andres Perez: Sounds like a chill day, I guess you deserve it after your weekend
10/31/22, 7:30 PM - Andres Perez: Which podcast did you listen?
10/31/22, 7:30 PM - Andres Perez: Same, studying, listing to a podcast, some exercise and I went to get some glasses 🕶️🤓🤓
10/31/22, 7:31 PM - Andres Perez: Btw, is your interview this week?
10/31/22, 7:58 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
10/31/22, 9:29 PM - Anki: Two Dutch ones and The diary of a ceo (with Gabby Logan and one with Maisie Williams)
10/31/22, 9:29 PM - Anki: Sounds like a good day too! Which podcast did you listen to?
10/31/22, 9:30 PM - Anki: No next week!
10/31/22, 9:30 PM - Anki: Nice!! Sounds like a book you can read over and over again, since you will inevitably forget things
10/31/22, 9:38 PM - Andres Perez: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uGLujDgVPl0w0oXS1GsxG?si=HcBSM5EKQdCJt_8a3QeUYw&utm_source=whatsapp
10/31/22, 9:38 PM - Andres Perez: Oh, I like that podcast, but haven't listened to that specific one, was it good?
10/31/22, 9:40 PM - Andres Perez: This one and the line also.
This is about what we were discussing the other day, free will as an illusion, it's kind of align with what I think, but it's confusing sometimes, I feel dump haha
10/31/22, 9:40 PM - Andres Perez: Ohh, I am sure is gonna go well :)
10/31/22, 9:40 PM - Anki: I don't know this podcast, so good tip for tomorrow:)
10/31/22, 9:41 PM - Anki: Yes, i liked the one with Gabby Logan, don't know if you know her? But I think what she has done is quite awesome
10/31/22, 9:41 PM - Andres Perez: Actually, I always forget everything about this book 😅 not sure why 😂
10/31/22, 9:42 PM - Anki: And the one with Maisie (Ayra Stark in Game of Thrones), is interesting, but you can hear she is still looking for answers herself, so different type of podcast than the other episodes
10/31/22, 9:42 PM - Andres Perez: I don't, I'll give it a shot tomorrow
10/31/22, 9:42 PM - Anki: Maybe so you have a good reason to read it again and be amazed once more
10/31/22, 9:43 PM - Anki: She was one of the first female football journalists at a big broadcast, for a long time the only women in a men's environment
10/31/22, 9:43 PM - Anki: And had some great tragedies in her life, so it's about grief too
10/31/22, 9:43 PM - Anki: Thanks:)
10/31/22, 9:44 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, maybe unconsciously I forget everything I really enjoy to be amazed everytime I reread it or rewatch it.
10/31/22, 9:45 PM - Andres Perez: Definitely I'll give it a try, thanks for the recommendation :)
10/31/22, 9:45 PM - Andres Perez: This podcast is soo good, he always has the most amazing guests and he is able to level up for it
10/31/22, 9:45 PM - Anki: ☺️
10/31/22, 9:46 PM - Anki: Cool! Thanks for your recommendation:)!
10/31/22, 9:46 PM - Anki: I;m gonna go through some photos, for a friends PDH-celebtration, slaap lekker alvast!

11/2/22, 11:36 AM - Anki: And sometimes good to run through it
11/2/22, 11:36 AM - Anki: And also sometimes not 😅
11/2/22, 11:37 AM - Anki: Could you meet tomorrow also at 12:30/13:00 instead of 14?
11/2/22, 11:37 AM - Andres Perez: Sometimes I do prefer instant reward instead of waiting for years haha
11/2/22, 11:38 AM - Andres Perez: Did you train on Monday?
11/2/22, 11:38 AM - Andres Perez: Well, let me check with my busy agenda 🧐
11/2/22, 11:38 AM - Anki: Haha yes I agree, but then sometimes = almost always.
11/2/22, 11:38 AM - Anki: Yes it was quite nice actually, but still sore muscles haha
11/2/22, 11:39 AM - Andres Perez: Yes, I am available, I made a free spot for you. Just cancelled my power nap time. Haha
11/2/22, 11:39 AM - Anki: Hahaha
11/2/22, 11:39 AM - Anki: Thank you very much
11/2/22, 11:39 AM - Andres Perez: Haha yeah, I just wanted to sound interesting, but also almost always
11/2/22, 11:40 AM - Anki: Will have volunteer work, it’s called @ease and is for youngsters who can come by and talk freely and anonymously about what ever is on their mind
11/2/22, 11:40 AM - Anki: Like the honesty
11/2/22, 11:41 AM - Andres Perez: Walking weirdly then? Same here haha
11/2/22, 11:42 AM - Anki: From the match on Sunday? Or did you do other things

11/2/22, 11:42 AM - Andres Perez: Sounds interesting, what people talk about mostly?
11/2/22, 11:44 AM - Andres Perez: I am starting to train for my half iron man, so I am doing HIIT classes almost every day
11/2/22, 11:45 AM - Andres Perez: Well, I can wait til tomorrow to talk about this :)
11/2/22, 11:46 AM - Anki: I don’t know what HIIT classes are, but sounds already intense
11/2/22, 11:46 AM - Anki: 😂
11/2/22, 11:47 AM - Anki: Yes! Let you know tomorrow morning, okay?
11/2/22, 11:47 AM - Anki: Haha lets do so
11/2/22, 11:49 AM - Andres Perez: Sounds good
11/2/22, 11:50 AM - Andres Perez: It is, so I consider all my life decisions after every class, cause I finish destroyed 😅
11/2/22, 12:26 PM - Anki: I have to be back in Amsterdam around 17 by the way
11/2/22, 12:34 PM - Andres Perez: Sure, that's fine.
11/2/22, 12:35 PM - Andres Perez: We have enough time :)
11/2/22, 12:36 PM - Anki: :)

11/3/22, 1:06 PM - Andres Perez: I am at the entrance of Starbucks
11/3/22, 1:07 PM - Andres Perez: I mean, the side of Starbucks 😅
11/3/22, 4:16 PM - Andres Perez: Success in your poetry session and enjoy the dinner 😊
11/3/22, 4:25 PM - Anki: Gracias :)
11/4/22, 9:07 AM - Andres Perez: Good morning. How was your poetry session and the dinner?
11/4/22, 9:53 AM - Anki: Morning :) poetry session was nice! Inspiring and out of my comfort zone so that was fun. Dinner also nice
11/4/22, 9:56 AM - Anki: I started an action. I read this week that 1 out of 4 women of Amsterdam sometimes don’t have the money for tampons or pads and that they have to choose between tampons and bread. And in the whole country it’s 1 our of 10. It shocked me. But now there points where they can pick stuff up for free and I’m collecting, so yesterday at dinner my friend brought the first supply :)
11/4/22, 9:56 AM - Anki: How was it to see the movie again?
11/4/22, 9:56 AM - Anki: And how was hitt?
11/4/22, 10:52 AM - Andres Perez: Nice to hear. I guess you are getting better at it 🙂
11/4/22, 10:53 AM - Andres Perez: Wow 😮, I had no idea about that issue, That's really nice of you.
Let me know if I can help also.
11/4/22, 10:54 AM - Andres Perez: It was almost like watching it for the first time, It's a really nice movie
11/4/22, 10:55 AM - Andres Perez: It was brutal, So much pain in my abds which I love haha
11/4/22, 11:02 AM - Andres Perez: Btw, I forgot to mention, I am going to Budapest from this Tuesday to Sunday.
I would like to see you before that if you have some time 😊
11/4/22, 4:03 PM - Anki: Oh nice, good travel plans are coming up! Do you go by plane or train? And what time will you go Tuesday? We might can see each other before you go around amsterdam centraal? Cause my weekend is quite busy and Monday got to play soccer :)
11/4/22, 4:03 PM - Anki: We had to do all of these exercises for our voice, was nice
11/4/22, 4:04 PM - Anki: Cool! Can you tell me the name once more?
11/4/22, 4:06 PM - Anki: I also didn’t know until this week. Sweet that you want to help! You can buy products and give them to me, so I can send it to the right place. Or you can transfer money to a ngo: NL19 INGB 0006 2638 41 t.n.v. Stichting Armoedefonds and as a subject you should state: “menstruatie armoede”, so your money will be used for that specific project
11/4/22, 4:06 PM - Anki: Have fun tonight at the concert!
11/5/22, 1:09 AM - Andres Perez: Indeed. :) But I got a call from my boss and most probably I'll start working in my project the same day I come back from Thailand 😢 I don't think I will be able to go to Mexico for Christmas this year. 😪
11/5/22, 1:10 AM - Anki: Ahh 😓😥 I’m sorry to hear that
11/5/22, 1:10 AM - Anki: And you can’t work a bit from there?
11/5/22, 1:11 AM - Andres Perez: Actually I am flying from Brussels, long story, I'll tell you on Tuesday if we meet, but I have to be a bit before 15:00 in Sloterdijk. Can you around 12-13 maybe? :) And of course in Amsterdam.
11/5/22, 1:11 AM - Andres Perez: Yes, I origins
11/5/22, 1:12 AM - Andres Perez: I will make a transfer then :) so you don't have to carry stuff around.
11/5/22, 1:13 AM - Andres Perez: Thanks, it was really nice actually. There was a mariachi and this Mexican band. You also have fun with all your plans this weekend
11/5/22, 1:13 AM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
11/5/22, 1:13 AM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
11/5/22, 1:15 AM - Andres Perez: Probably, but I'd have to start at 2 am. I'll check those days
11/5/22, 1:15 AM - Anki: A real party!
11/5/22, 1:15 AM - Anki: As in looks festive
11/5/22, 1:15 AM - Andres Perez: Exercise for your voice? Which ones exactly?
11/5/22, 1:16 AM - Anki: Will respond to the rest later, already so sleepy! Went to my cousins birthday but now time for bed 😅
11/5/22, 1:16 AM - Andres Perez: Did she like the game?
11/5/22, 1:16 AM - Andres Perez: Sure, same here
11/5/22, 1:17 AM - Andres Perez: Goedenacht 💤😴 😘
11/5/22, 5:54 PM - Anki: Yes she was happy with it :)
11/5/22, 5:54 PM - Anki: Yes could make that work :)
11/5/22, 5:54 PM - Anki: How are you today?
11/5/22, 7:03 PM - Andres Perez: Great! See you on Tuesday then. Let me check what we can do that early in Ams :)
11/5/22, 7:04 PM - Andres Perez: I am good, I woke up a bit tired, but then a power nap helped a lot 👌🏽🙌🏾
11/5/22, 7:04 PM - Andres Perez: Ah, I didn't have a good sleep cause I was cold and I didn't understand why, then I realized that the window was open 😅
11/5/22, 7:05 PM - Andres Perez: How about you? How are you doing today?
11/5/22, 7:06 PM - Andres Perez: And how was the birthday. Did you have fun?
11/6/22, 10:16 PM - Anki: Glad you could fit it in your schedule yesterday ;)
11/6/22, 10:18 PM - Anki: I played soccer, it was a tight game but in the end we won 3-1. And then there was oktoberfest at the club, so that was interesting. And this morning my alarm was set at 8 cause I went foraging with friends, we gave it as a birthdaypresent
11/6/22, 10:19 PM - Anki: It was really nice, you can eat so much more than i knew you could. But i was also tired and bit hangover, but one of my friend was worse, so that kind of helped me through the day 😅
11/6/22, 10:19 PM - Anki: How are you doing?
11/6/22, 10:19 PM - Anki: What did you do today?
11/6/22, 11:03 PM - Andres Perez: Indeed, today I felt asleep during the afternoon too 😅
11/6/22, 11:05 PM - Andres Perez: Oktoberfest sounds so much fun, for me beer is always my drink to go. Oh, did you learn to identify some nice food? I can't imagine you can eat a lot
11/6/22, 11:07 PM - Andres Perez: Haha is always good to have a friend like that close in those moments
11/6/22, 11:10 PM - Andres Perez: We had a match and lost 6-1.😅 The other team was simply better and one goal was my fault 😢😅 then hanging out with the team, power nap, groceries, playing piano and now chilling watching some interesting videos about perception and reality
11/7/22, 11:14 AM - Anki: Yes, I’ve forgot a lot of things too, but some knowledge stayed :)
11/7/22, 11:14 AM - Anki: Haha yes indeed
11/7/22, 11:17 AM - Anki: Sounds like a perfect Sunday, except from the lost. But well when the other team is better, it’s a fair win. Never nice when you’re responsible for one of the goals, but sounds like it wasn’t a due or die moment, so hopefully you’ve forgotten it by now :)
11/7/22, 11:51 AM - Andres Perez: If you get lost in a the Amazon, you might have some chances to survive :)
11/7/22, 11:52 AM - Andres Perez: It was a nice Sunday indeed.
And we didn't have enough players so I was right back and usually I am winger and left foot, so I already forgave myself haha
11/7/22, 11:52 AM - Andres Perez: Have a nice day a week btw! 🫂
11/7/22, 3:02 PM - Anki: Haha yes hopefully. Although these Dutch plants wouldn’t be there so I will be still lost haha
11/7/22, 3:03 PM - Anki: You too!
11/7/22, 8:15 PM - Andres Perez: Haha well, you'd survive if you get lost in the Dutch Jungle, in the imaginary case that there os such a thing haha
11/7/22, 8:15 PM - Andres Perez: Shall we have brunch tomorrow around 12:30?
11/7/22, 10:00 PM - Anki: Yes! I know a nice place in Westerpark. Shall I come and pick you up at centraal?
11/8/22, 7:55 AM - Andres Perez: That sounds like a good plan and then we can just go together, is 12:15 also fine? Just to avoid being in a rush to take the bus
11/8/22, 9:54 AM - Anki: I’m afraid I only can make 12:30
11/8/22, 9:58 AM - Anki: What time do you need to have the bus?
11/8/22, 10:06 AM - Andres Perez: 24:45 at Sloterdijk
11/8/22, 10:06 AM - Andres Perez: No worries, 12:30 it's fine :)
11/8/22, 10:18 AM - Anki: Oké:)
11/8/22, 11:28 AM - Anki: Orrr lets meet at Bret
11/8/22, 11:28 AM - Anki: It’s a place where we can have lunch, naar Sloterdijk
11/8/22, 11:28 AM - Anki: Naar = near
11/8/22, 11:28 AM - Anki: So then we can almost see your train coming
11/8/22, 11:31 AM - Andres Perez: Do you like that place?
11/8/22, 11:34 AM - Andres Perez: Let's do that then :) see you there 12:30
11/8/22, 11:35 AM - Anki: Never been there but my roommate said it was nice (the one I had in mind is a bit far to walk and since you have all your stuff)
11/8/22, 11:37 AM - Anki: 12:45 there? Sloterdijk is far (live in the East, so won’t make 12:30)
11/8/22, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: Well, it's a small 🎒, no worries about that
11/8/22, 11:44 AM - Andres Perez: Sure, I'll make it up to you next time.
11/8/22, 11:50 AM - Anki: No worries 😘
11/8/22, 11:51 AM - Anki: I have to leave around 14:45 as well, cause have a training. But see you in a bit, I’ll hurry :)
11/8/22, 12:39 PM - Andres Perez: It's closed 😅. Good news there are a few other places within 5 mins walking :)
11/8/22, 12:39 PM - Andres Perez: Koffie Academie Sloterdijk looks good
11/8/22, 12:39 PM - Andres Perez: I am outside Bret sitting on a bench
11/8/22, 12:42 PM - Anki: Oh no! I looked it up, but guess google isn’t always right
11/8/22, 12:42 PM - Anki: See you in a bit
11/8/22, 2:43 PM - Andres Perez: Had a lovely time 😊 I'll see you when I get back 😘
11/8/22, 3:38 PM - Anki: Me too! Thanks for the lunch, that’s really sweet
11/8/22, 3:38 PM - Anki: Have a great time 😚
11/8/22, 5:49 PM - Andres Perez: Thanks :) how was your training btw?
11/8/22, 5:50 PM - Anki: It was online but their internet connection was really bad, so wasn’t able to follow it :(
11/8/22, 5:50 PM - Anki: Will receive the slides though
11/8/22, 5:50 PM - Anki: Are you now at Brussels airport?
11/8/22, 5:54 PM - Andres Perez: Too bad :( they might repeat it?
11/8/22, 5:56 PM - Andres Perez: In 30 mins :) although I just realized that my flight is from another airport 😂 the time is really constraint, but I think I can make it. I bought my train and bus tickets. So, I'll just have to run 😅
11/8/22, 5:57 PM - Anki: We’ll see :)
11/8/22, 5:57 PM - Anki: Oh nooo! Sounds stressful
11/8/22, 5:57 PM - Anki: But here comes your Hitt in handy
11/8/22, 5:58 PM - Anki: You can run so fast, you’ll be all right
11/8/22, 6:04 PM - Andres Perez: I just hope that I run in the correct direction, otherwise it will be more hustle
11/8/22, 6:31 PM - Anki: 😂
11/8/22, 6:31 PM - Anki: This would be my fear as well
11/8/22, 6:50 PM - Andres Perez: I won't make it 😢😪 the is one hour delayed 😔
11/8/22, 6:50 PM - Anki: Noooooo
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Anki: The train is delayed?
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Andres Perez: 😅 second day I missed a plane
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Anki: You’re sure you won’t make it? Like running over the airport won’t help?
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Anki: 😣 when was the first?
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Andres Perez: The bus hasn't arrived yet and it was supposed to be there 18:25
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Anki: :((
11/8/22, 6:51 PM - Anki: And a taxi?
11/8/22, 6:53 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 6:53 PM - Andres Perez: I don't care missing my flight, but didn't want to let my friend down 😪
11/8/22, 6:54 PM - Andres Perez: Anyways, I think I might come back by train in a bit 😅 just double checking my options
11/8/22, 6:54 PM - Anki: Yes I understand!
11/8/22, 6:54 PM - Anki: Cant you go by train?
11/8/22, 6:54 PM - Anki: I know I did it once
11/8/22, 6:55 PM - Anki: With interrailing, but then had multiple stops
11/8/22, 6:55 PM - Anki: Will be very long in one take
11/8/22, 6:55 PM - Anki: Yeah, or maybe you find a cheap ticket for tomorrow or anything? And then stay a night in Brussels
11/8/22, 6:56 PM - Anki: Good luck 😚
11/8/22, 7:13 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 7:20 PM - Anki: Awww, I’m really sorry to hear that
11/8/22, 7:20 PM - Anki: Zo jammer!
11/8/22, 7:25 PM - Andres Perez: At least I took a power nap in the bus :)
11/8/22, 7:28 PM - Anki: Hahah
11/8/22, 7:28 PM - Anki: That counts for something
11/8/22, 7:34 PM - Andres Perez: It's fine, I like to think that is not the big deal, at least nobody died :)
11/8/22, 7:37 PM - Anki: Haha that’s true
11/8/22, 7:37 PM - Anki: Luckily not
11/8/22, 7:38 PM - Anki: But can imagine you’re disappointed
11/8/22, 7:41 PM - Andres Perez: 3 years ago to go from Budapest to Ams 😂
11/8/22, 7:42 PM - Andres Perez: Have you missed a plane ever?
11/8/22, 7:42 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, a bit. I just called both friends and everything is fine
11/8/22, 7:50 PM - Anki: Good, nice they understood
11/8/22, 7:50 PM - Anki: Haha the other way around
11/8/22, 7:50 PM - Anki: No
11/8/22, 7:54 PM - Anki: What time will you be in amsterdam?
11/8/22, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: Yes, they got mad with flixbus also :)
11/8/22, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: I just boarded the train, I'll be there 9:40 more less
11/8/22, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: I should've taken the train from Ams in the first place haha
11/8/22, 7:56 PM - Andres Perez: Instead of the bus, but too late for regrets haha
11/8/22, 7:56 PM - Anki: Haha yes true
11/8/22, 7:56 PM - Anki: Did you had time to explore Antwerpen then?
11/8/22, 7:56 PM - Anki: It’s a nice city
11/8/22, 7:56 PM - Anki: But can imagine if you weren’t particularly in the mood ;)
11/8/22, 7:57 PM - Andres Perez: Not really, but I've been there a few times already. Indeed is a nice city
11/8/22, 7:58 PM - Andres Perez: I was mostly hungry, I got a donut with diabetes  😄
11/8/22, 8:00 PM - Andres Perez: Also, the good news is that we can meet before Monday if you have some time 😊
11/8/22, 8:00 PM - Anki: Wanna come over tonight?

11/12/22, 1:57 PM - Andres Perez: Today you are going to Rotterdam, right?
11/12/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: On my way
11/12/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: Just played the first leg and scored the first goal
11/12/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: 🥳
11/12/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: Played centre mid, my fave. Then rushed into the shower and public transport
11/12/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: How are you?
11/12/22, 1:59 PM - Anki: (But the game wasn’t nice, felt like we weren’t playing as a team, so to be honest, I left the field quite frustrated)
11/12/22, 2:00 PM - Andres Perez: That's always nice
11/12/22, 2:00 PM - Andres Perez: Specially when everybody celebrates with you
11/12/22, 2:01 PM - Andres Perez: That happens sometimes, will be better next time, I hope you can just let it go since also you scored a goal
11/12/22, 2:01 PM - Andres Perez: I am good, just came back from my HIIT class and I'll study a few hours
11/12/22, 2:11 PM - Anki: And how is your back today?
11/12/22, 2:12 PM - Anki: Yes! And today it’s exactly 6 years ago I got my concussion on the soccerpitch, at a Saturday
11/12/22, 2:12 PM - Anki: Nicole brought cake as a surprise to remind it 😍
11/12/22, 2:13 PM - Anki: Yeah I played all righty that’s all I can control (well and a bit of the mentality)
11/12/22, 2:15 PM - Andres Perez: Still in a bit of pain today. So, I am arranging an appointment with my physio and getting a new mattress. I am definitely getting old haha
11/12/22, 2:16 PM - Andres Perez: Oh, how did you feel about it?
11/12/22, 2:16 PM - Andres Perez: That's really nice. You indeed have really good friends. Who is Nicole btw? I forgot, your ex-flatmate?
11/12/22, 2:34 PM - Anki: Yeah, welcome to the club
11/12/22, 2:35 PM - Anki: I don’t know to be honest, it feels a bit wierd. It has definitely been the best year since I got hit, but still sometimes unbelievable that 1 seconds changed my life that drastically and that I still have to deal with the consequences. But overall happy I came this far
11/12/22, 2:36 PM - Anki: Yes Nicole is my ex-flatmate, best friend, teammate
11/12/22, 2:36 PM - Anki: And congrats with your friends birthday
11/12/22, 2:56 PM - Andres Perez: I am still a bit on denial about joining the club haha resisting as long as my body allows me
11/12/22, 2:57 PM - Andres Perez: I can not even imagine how difficult it has been, but you have come this far, so you should be proud of yourself 🙂
Indeed, sometimes, a second changes everything. I guess sometimes we just need to accept it and keep pushing
11/12/22, 2:58 PM - Andres Perez: Okay, I will remember from now on
11/12/22, 2:58 PM - Andres Perez: Thanks, it's a bit weird this Dutch tradition for me, but I appreciate the gesture
11/12/22, 3:01 PM - Anki: Well it’s a good sign we’re getting old ☺️
11/12/22, 3:01 PM - Anki: ☺️ No worries, you already guessed right this time
11/12/22, 3:02 PM - Anki: Hahah i only came to understand this year it’s a Dutch tradition. Guess we’re not that individual after all 😉
11/12/22, 3:09 PM - Andres Perez: What do you mean?
11/12/22, 3:09 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, that's true, but still is weird for me haha
11/12/22, 3:10 PM - Andres Perez: Have a nice day in Rotterdam, What is exactly "presentacion de libre"?
11/12/22, 3:20 PM - Anki: Book release, didn’t know what it was in Spanish haha. In Dutch: boek presentatie so that’s how i translated it
11/12/22, 4:27 PM - Andres Perez: Presentación de libro actually works haha
11/12/22, 7:54 PM - Anki: 😌

11/13/22, 3:06 AM - Andres Perez: Yes, I would like to hear about that :)
11/13/22, 3:08 AM - Andres Perez: It was nice, just got home, my friend got super drunk haha it was fun. But it's different than in previous years
11/13/22, 3:08 AM - Andres Perez: Sleep well bonita 😘
11/13/22, 12:26 PM - Anki: Sounds good. How was it different? Cause you were sober or other things?

11/13/22, 4:53 PM - Andres Perez: Thanks, we won, but my balls got hit with the ball once 😅😩 haha
11/13/22, 4:53 PM - Andres Perez: That was not fun

11/13/22, 5:51 PM - Andres Perez: How is your time with your family?
11/13/22, 7:38 PM - Anki: Haha that’s a start :)
11/13/22, 7:39 PM - Anki: Nice! We just had dinner at a Mexican restaurant, so thought of you :)
11/13/22, 7:39 PM - Anki: Bit early, cause my brother has to catch a train to Delft. So now I’m gonna meet some friends in de kroeg
11/13/22, 7:40 PM - Anki: And you, what are you up to?
11/13/22, 7:40 PM - Anki: Oh and the walk was really nice!
11/13/22, 10:29 PM - Andres Perez: No way, how was the food? 😊
11/13/22, 10:30 PM - Andres Perez: When are you coming back to ams?

11/13/22, 10:47 PM - Anki: Sounds like fun
11/13/22, 10:49 PM - Anki: I end up with a friend in een bruine kroeg, but then it turned out elderly people were singing folksongs and there was a accordionist as well and we got a book with lyrics and ended up singing along
11/13/22, 10:50 PM - Anki: On Saturday you will go to Vietnam right?
11/13/22, 10:54 PM - Andres Perez: Haha i probably eat it happily and don't approve at the end

11/20/22, 11:09 AM - Anki: Yes I did. 1-1, against nr 2 (were at the top at the moment), but it wasn’t fun, they were playing rugby and the referee was on their side

11/20/22, 11:09 AM - Anki: Thank you! Yes I’m doing better! But feel a bit blue, but I’ll figure it out :)

11/22/22, 5:50 PM - Andres Perez: I am so sorry to hear that. But don't punish yourself for things that are not under your control. Things like this usually happens, but what is important is to keep trying :) I send you a hug and a kiss.

11/28/22, 7:22 AM - Andres Perez: True, although I think the trip in a car would be much better
11/28/22, 7:24 AM - Andres Perez: Oh are you feeling okay? Football can be dangerous. Yeah, I guess is the best if you have a little break to recover properly
11/28/22, 7:24 AM - Andres Perez: That sounds fun. Laughing a lot?
11/28/22, 11:06 AM - Anki: Haha what an inconvenience
11/28/22, 11:06 AM - Anki: Motorcycle sounds more romantic, but that’s the thing, sometimes things sounds more romantic than they are
11/28/22, 11:07 AM - Anki: Yeah exactly, don’t feel great, but hope to recover quickly
11/28/22, 11:07 AM - Anki: This was nice though, very good and relaxed distraction
11/28/22, 7:10 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, today we literally spent all day travelling. At least to our final destination by bike. But my ass is suffering
11/28/22, 7:10 PM - Andres Perez: Haha
11/28/22, 7:10 PM - Andres Perez: I guess with more days it's pretty okay. But we are in a rush. That complicates stuff
11/28/22, 7:10 PM - Andres Perez: Yes, I am sure you will. Do you still feel any pain?
11/28/22, 7:15 PM - Andres Perez: How was your day?
11/28/22, 7:15 PM - Andres Perez: Today we got to Hanoi, extremely tired we watched a match and now about to sleel
11/28/22, 7:15 PM - Andres Perez: Have you been watching matches?
11/29/22, 2:13 AM - Anki: Ahh I’m sorry to hear it doesn’t meet your expectations. But luckily hiking is (almost? Or now?) over. Time for your butt to heal ☺️
11/29/22, 10:35 AM - Anki: Yeah in my neck, but now waiting for the chiropractor
11/29/22, 10:37 AM - Anki: Haven’t been watching, cause for me it feels wierd to cheer and be in tension for a match while I know thousands of people have died during building all the facilities. I know I don’t change that fact by not watching, but untill now i didn’t feel good watching. But I might watch today, I’m still open to change my mind
11/29/22, 10:37 AM - Anki: Is the vibe still nice with your friends? Or is everybody a pain in the ass due to the pain in the ass?
11/29/22, 5:13 PM - Andres Perez: No worries about it, it was still nice, but no the best choice.
11/29/22, 5:14 PM - Andres Perez: Yes, my butt can heal, maybe I need a message. Haha would you give me an ass massage when I get back? 🤣 I could do the same
11/29/22, 5:15 PM - Andres Perez: Ohh, I'll give you a neck massage also, lots of kisses should help no?
11/29/22, 5:16 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, I know, it sucks. No sure if there is much to do about it
11/29/22, 5:16 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, still nice, complaining and enjoying
11/29/22, 5:16 PM - Andres Perez: How about your week?
11/30/22, 11:33 AM - Anki: Haha yes I can help you with that 😌
11/30/22, 11:33 AM - Anki: Sounds like a good combination!

12/17/22, 11:53 AM - Andres Perez: How was your day?
12/17/22, 12:54 PM - Anki: <Media omitted>
12/17/22, 1:23 PM - Andres Perez: Hey,
I just finished my HIIT class and I listened to the voice message. I'll answer properly a bit later. But no worries. Everything is alright :) I understand it can happen
12/17/22, 4:01 PM - Anki: Ahh thanks a lot for your message 😘
12/17/22, 11:41 PM - Anki: And take your time to answer later :) we can also call if you like!
12/18/22, 1:11 PM - Andres Perez: Hola,
First of all, thanks for your message and honesty. I really appreciate it. As we discussed previously, we were in the same page and obviously something like this could happen. I think we like each other, but probably to much enough which is also fine. So, no worries at all, take your time and think it through. No hard feelings at all :)
12/18/22, 1:57 PM - Anki: Gracias por entenderlo 🙏🏻😙
12/18/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: And giving me time :)
12/18/22, 1:58 PM - Anki: What do you mean by “but probably to much enough which is also fine”
12/19/22, 4:38 PM - Andres Perez: Cause you met someone and made you confused, I don't think that happens when you are already really into someone.
Also, I've been thinking and as I mentioned I also like my freedom, probably I am not ready for something serious. So, no worries everything is alright. Take your time to think and I'd be happy if you wanna hang out from time to time :)
12/22/22, 1:17 PM - Anki: So nice everything is all right for you :)! Makes me more calm, so i appreciate it ☺️
12/22/22, 1:18 PM - Anki: These days quite busy anyways, with Christmas and New Years, I’ll text you afterwards 😚
12/22/22, 1:18 PM - Anki: But really curious though, how is the new job coming along? Do you understand what you have to do yet;)? Can you keep track?
12/22/22, 9:54 PM - Andres Perez: Sure, no worries :) enjoy these days! 😘
12/24/22, 2:08 PM - Anki: Feliz Navidad!
12/24/22, 2:09 PM - Anki: Unfortunately you're not with your family this year, but hopefully you'll be surrounded by other people that you love for these Christmasdays
