* **`components/fine_tunning/`:** The heart of model customization:
    * **`util.py`:** Google Cloud Storage interaction made easy.
    * **`trainer.py`:** Fine-tuning Gemma models with LoRA for personalized responses. 
    * **`conversion_function.py`:** Converting fine-tuned models to the versatile Hugging Face format.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** Defining the environment for efficient fine-tuning within a container. 
* **`components/app_flask/`:** Where the user experience comes alive:
    * **`app.py`:** Handling user management, chatbot interaction, and API calls.
    * **`util.py`:** Supporting the Flask application with essential functions.
    * **`templates/`:** Housing the HTML templates that define the web interface.
    * **`static/`:** Storing CSS and JavaScript files for a visually appealing and interactive experience.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** Building the containerized environment for the Flask application.
* **`components/pipeline/`:** Orchestrating the magic with Kubeflow Pipelines:
    * **`pipeline.py`:** Defining the pipeline structure and its individual components.
    * **`util.py`:** Providing helper functions for path construction and model configuration.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** Setting up the container environment for the pipeline.
* **`components/cloud_functions/`:** Automating pipeline triggers:
    * **`trigger_pipeline.py`:** Implementing the Cloud Function that initiates the pipeline upon user registration.
    * **`main.py`:** Handling the function's entry point and processing events. 
* **`components/data_preparation/`:** Transforming raw data into training gold:
    * **`data_ingestion.py`:** Ingesting and formatting user data for optimal training.
    * **`task.py`:** Serving as the entry point for data preparation tasks.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** Defining the container environment for data preparation tasks. 

**Bringing Your Chatbot to Life:**
