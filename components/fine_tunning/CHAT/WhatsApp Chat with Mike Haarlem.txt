Hope you are enjoying your trip.
I wanted to let you know that I didn't reply cause I don't think a  response was deserved if I felt treated like a hotel. 

I don’t like to feel that my  generosity and hospitality are being abused. Especially when it already happened once in Italy. I won’t simply allow anyone to walk all over me.
4/20/23, 2:38 PM - Andres Perez: Do you think it is too much? Haha
