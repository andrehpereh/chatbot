1/17/20, 7:53 PM - Andres Perez: Being the small one
1/17/20, 7:53 PM - Michael: I dont want to feel you dürüm in my pita
1/17/20, 7:55 PM - Michael: Doctor said that it shouldn't be anything too serious but it will be painful probably for another week. They gave me some cream that numbs so i can put in my mouth and if it does not get any better by monday then i go again
1/17/20, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: Maybe you don't want it but your need it
1/17/20, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: What do you have in your month?
1/17/20, 7:55 PM - Andres Perez: Did you get herpes?
1/17/20, 8:12 PM - Michael: Doctor said probably just a very strong aphta but other option would be herpes activation stronger than normal.
1/17/20, 8:12 PM - Michael: Almost all of us have herpes technically
1/17/20, 8:13 PM - Michael: 70% and what i have is not on the lip which would be the classic herpes reaction
1/17/20, 8:13 PM - Michael: Mine is literally in the mouth undervthe tongue on the gums and on the ceiling of the mouth
1/17/20, 8:13 PM - Michael: I was also confused that its aphta because aphta is usually one little dot on your tongue
1/17/20, 8:14 PM - Michael: But maybe herpes
1/17/20, 8:14 PM - Michael: If never goes away than possibly cancer but we don't think about that yet
1/17/20, 8:17 PM - Andres Perez: You will be fine soon with that broo!
1/17/20, 8:17 PM - Andres Perez: I'll could come over tomorrow for a bit

1/17/20, 8:18 PM - Andres Perez: Did you get medicine? Just cream?
1/17/20, 8:19 PM - Michael: Just cream
1/17/20, 8:19 PM - Michael: It should take the pain away a little for a while i should be able to eat more
1/17/20, 8:20 PM - Andres Perez: Frank has some pills, though
1/17/20, 8:20 PM - Andres Perez: You will be better at least for a couple of hours 😉
1/17/20, 8:20 PM - Michael: Yeah he bought me paracetamol but doesn't help

10/8/21, 9:56 PM - Andres Perez: Agriculture field outside of the landing zone 😅
10/8/21, 9:57 PM - Andres Perez: I think you should contact your bank and ask them
10/8/21, 9:57 PM - Andres Perez: It seems that depends on the.
10/11/21, 6:56 PM - Andres Perez: Did you call them?
10/11/21, 7:27 PM - Michael: Ill send them a mail
10/11/21, 7:28 PM - Michael: You almost died jumping? 😅
10/11/21, 7:34 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah 😅
10/11/21, 7:34 PM - Andres Perez: But apparently it's pretty normal 😂
10/11/21, 7:35 PM - Michael: Were u scared at that moment?
10/11/21, 7:35 PM - Andres Perez: I knew they would open it in case I couldn't reach it, I was frustrated, I felt that i was fucking stupid
10/11/21, 7:35 PM - Andres Perez: It's fucking easy, but somehow I didn't manage
10/11/21, 7:36 PM - Andres Perez: The problem is that the practice is already up there
10/11/21, 7:37 PM - Andres Perez: With the wind
10/11/21, 7:38 PM - Michael: Yeah and i bet the wind is so strong its hard to recognize what your feeling
10/11/21, 7:38 PM - Michael: Happy to see you back on ig
10/11/21, 7:38 PM - Michael: 😅 set some kind of time limiting app for ig so you dont over use it
10/11/21, 7:46 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, besides I was a bit nervous, I was jumping out of a fucking plane 😂
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Michael: 😂 crazy that was the first time by yourself?
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, planing to close it once again when I finish my course, but let's see
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah haha I already did jump 5 times
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Michael: Was it then hard to control the parachute
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Michael: First time by yourself
10/11/21, 7:47 PM - Michael: You were still so hi
10/11/21, 7:48 PM - Michael: That would scare me so much being alone doing the parachute so high in the sky
10/11/21, 7:48 PM - Andres Perez: I was fucking stressed, didn't know how fast I was doing down, I was not sure If I was going to lane where I was supposed to, but at the end I managed
10/11/21, 7:48 PM - Andres Perez: Going down*
10/11/21, 7:48 PM - Andres Perez: Land*
10/11/21, 7:49 PM - Andres Perez: I had the landing videos as well
10/11/21, 7:49 PM - Andres Perez: After the third one it gets kind of simple
10/11/21, 7:50 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, I thought I was a bit relaxed, but I can see my freaking out face in the video jaja
10/11/21, 7:50 PM - Michael: 😂 amazing I couldn't do it
10/11/21, 7:52 PM - Andres Perez: I had to repeat the level 3 two times, I was getting so frustrated, but then I talked to my friends and the guys who jump really often as hobby and they told me that all of them repeat the that level
10/11/21, 7:52 PM - Michael: 😅 everyone is Mexican?
10/11/21, 7:52 PM - Andres Perez: And more frustrated means more tense and stressed I was, and the trick to do it properly, is to jump super relaxed
10/11/21, 7:52 PM - Andres Perez: Yup
10/11/21, 7:53 PM - Michael: Yeah forget that for me
10/11/21, 7:53 PM - Andres Perez: Eh?
10/11/21, 7:53 PM - Michael: Jumping out relaxed 😂
10/11/21, 7:54 PM - Michael: But its cool your doing it 🙌🏼
10/11/21, 7:58 PM - Andres Perez: The night before I was thinking, What that fuck am I doing? why? hahaha
10/11/21, 7:59 PM - Andres Perez: Still don't know, but I think is fucking cool
10/11/21, 7:59 PM - Andres Perez: Are you feeling better btw?
10/11/21, 8:00 PM - Michael: No had a doctor appointment today he didnt find anything. Im mostly having some kind of anxiety at the moment almost constant. But dont want to talk about it now.
10/11/21, 8:00 PM - Michael: Ive been off work for almost a week.
10/11/21, 8:01 PM - Andres Perez: Got it, but keep me posted, bro :)

10/11/21, 8:03 PM - Andres Perez: Once I am there, I'll plan a trip to Finland probably in January
10/11/21, 8:04 PM - Michael: Yeah at my moms place for over a week now
10/11/21, 8:05 PM - Michael: Yeah once i start feeling better we can start thinking about this 😅 but yeah lets think of good dates
10/11/21, 8:18 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, better to be there in case you need some electrolites haha
10/11/21, 8:19 PM - Andres Perez: Cool! can't wait to meet some hot blonde Finnish girls with low self esteem and daddy issues hahaha
10/13/21, 9:13 PM - Andres Perez: <Media omitted>
10/14/21, 7:03 AM - Michael: Only size 😅
10/19/21, 11:32 AM - Andres Perez: How are you doing bro?
10/19/21, 11:33 AM - Michael: Remember that night when i was fucked up with my heart pounding like crazy
10/19/21, 11:34 AM - Michael: It was a panic attack at the same time as the heat exhaustion
10/19/21, 11:34 AM - Michael: I got another one in Finland
10/19/21, 11:35 AM - Michael: And almost again last friday. The psychiatrist and doctor suspect that that first one was such a traumatizing experience for my body that i developed a anxiety / panic disorder 😬
10/19/21, 11:35 AM - Michael: I started medication today
10/19/21, 11:36 AM - Andres Perez: Holy shit, where? How come? Any pattern of what it could have triggered?
10/19/21, 11:36 AM - Michael: Thats why i was having all those symptoms. It was my body "panicking" and being anxious that i will trigger it again
10/19/21, 11:37 AM - Michael: At home in the morning just woke up and 1min later almost called the ambulance
10/19/21, 11:37 AM - Andres Perez: Where you at your mom's?
10/19/21, 11:38 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah, that makes sense
10/19/21, 11:38 AM - Michael: No but now ive been for 2 weeks and the doctor gave me 2 weeks more holiday
10/19/21, 11:39 AM - Michael: And when i think about it it was probably the scariest moment ive ever felt
10/19/21, 11:40 AM - Michael: The one in mexico. Otherwise i feel ok tbh most of the time but all day anxious and sometimes more and sometimes less
10/19/21, 11:41 AM - Andres Perez: I guess you started feeling physically bad and it triggered the panic attack
10/19/21, 11:41 AM - Michael: Yeah guess so
10/19/21, 11:42 AM - Michael: I was pretty surprised that it has become this never thought i was that guy
10/19/21, 11:42 AM - Michael: But i guess it can happen to any of us just needs a trigger
10/19/21, 11:42 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah, probably
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: I'll read a bit about it, don't know much 😅
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Michael: Dont tell me scary shit ive read enough
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Michael: 😅 i need peace
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: Naa, I won't
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: More than ever
10/19/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: So how was your trip to Mexico in 2 words? Jaja
10/19/21, 11:44 AM - Michael: Only one word needed
10/19/21, 11:44 AM - Michael: Sick
10/19/21, 11:44 AM - Andres Perez: An experience
10/19/21, 3:05 PM - Andres Perez: Do you think the weed had something to do in Puerto Escondido?
10/19/21, 4:23 PM - Michael: No i dont think so everyone was smoking it. Of  it doesnt help with dehydration
10/19/21, 7:01 PM - Andres Perez: Maybe you need a couple of microdosis of LSD
10/19/21, 7:16 PM - Michael: we were laughing with Jasper that imagine a panic attack while on LSD
10/21/21, 12:34 PM - Andres Perez: Might be fun jaja
10/21/21, 12:34 PM - Andres Perez: How are you feeling with the medication and everything?
10/21/21, 12:36 PM - Michael: Yesterday felt horrible. All day, today much better. It really varies. Third day of medication very small dose for now and i think im fine with it. Shkukd start feeling the effects around 10-15 days in
10/21/21, 12:41 PM - Andres Perez: Horrible because of the medication? Or the usual symptoms? 😢
10/21/21, 12:42 PM - Andres Perez: Which medication did they give you?
10/21/21, 12:42 PM - Andres Perez: Have you tried cucharita all day long
10/21/21, 12:43 PM - Andres Perez: With a beautiful woman of course jaja
10/21/21, 12:43 PM - Andres Perez: That might always help
10/21/21, 12:43 PM - Michael: I dont know, the reaction is getting worse whenever i get very anxious but when im laying at home it's getting more controllable. I think it was already starting in mexico just the reactions were not as strong as now. Remember when i would complain about breathing problems
10/21/21, 12:44 PM - Michael: Some anti anxiety. I think it's basically the same as antidepressants
10/21/21, 12:45 PM - Michael: Also they gave me benzodiazepines so same as Jordan peterson for when it gets bad, so im trying not to use them at all but yesterday had to use 1.5 of the daily max 3
10/21/21, 12:48 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, the hard breathing you mentioned some times, the good thing that now you are at home at least
10/21/21, 12:52 PM - Andres Perez: Wow, yeah, try to avoid that thing as much as possible
10/21/21, 12:52 PM - Andres Perez: Are you having recurrent appointment with the doctor and psychiatrist?
10/21/21, 1:32 PM - Michael: Yeah i have my first psychiatrist on monday and i have reoccurring with my doctor they are going to make me a therapy plan as well. I knew i wasnt "just randomly" affected by the sun. Unfortunately this is actually worse but it will take some time but ill be better
10/21/21, 2:37 PM - Andres Perez: You'll get better and stronger bro 💪🏾🙌🏾
10/21/21, 2:38 PM - Andres Perez: Pretty weird it happened in Mexico tho, I don't think you were anxious or stressed
10/21/21, 2:38 PM - Andres Perez: Did they mention anything about alcohol
10/21/21, 2:52 PM - Michael: It can start from a traumatic incident and it has slowly grown since. I think it was that heat exhaustion. And i was anxious with the breathing i was at other points also but i didnt tell you. For example on the boat in the canyons i was feeling super shit but didnt tell you guys. And all those symptoms of me feeling nauseus and dizzy and difficulties breathing were part of it also.
10/21/21, 5:48 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, but you mentioned that the first panic attack was exactly at the same time?
I don't know much, but it sucks, you'll feel better soon bro 💪🏽💪🏽🙌🙌
You told us, but couple of days after
10/24/21, 7:57 PM - Andres Perez: How are you doing bro?
10/24/21, 7:57 PM - Andres Perez: I watched Manchester united match
10/28/21, 11:41 AM - Andres Perez: Are you okay?
10/28/21, 11:42 AM - Michael: Doing a bit better the worst is behind me. When i started the meds i was doing horribly and this week upped the dose. Still feeing effects but much more manageable
10/28/21, 11:42 AM - Michael: Leavingnthe house for a walk for the first time i  almost 2 weeks today
10/28/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: Wow, that was serious then, glad you are feeling better
10/28/21, 11:43 AM - Andres Perez: And everything is okay at work? What did they tell you?
10/28/21, 11:44 AM - Michael: Yep it clearly wasnt "just the sun"
10/28/21, 11:44 AM - Michael: Haven't worked in 2 weeks they told me bo problem take your time
10/28/21, 11:44 AM - Andres Perez: Just be careful with the one Jordan Peterson had also
10/28/21, 11:44 AM - Michael: I have anyways sick leave from the doctor
10/28/21, 11:45 AM - Andres Perez: It's Finland, of course would be fine haha
10/28/21, 11:45 AM - Andres Perez: I am having my dutch class right now and I hate it 😅
10/28/21, 11:45 AM - Michael: Yeah i had those benzos on the side if i needed them while taking the meds. Now i havent taken any in almost a week at some point i had to take 3 a day
10/28/21, 11:45 AM - Michael: You should be concentrated
10/28/21, 12:47 PM - Andres Perez: You'll get better soon 💪🏾💪🏾, never thought that this panic disorder could cause so much struggle
10/28/21, 12:47 PM - Andres Perez: It was my 2 minutes break
10/28/21, 12:48 PM - Andres Perez: At least with the meds you don't get your heart  pounding like crazy?
10/28/21, 1:08 PM - Michael: Yeah its more in control 🤞🏼
10/28/21, 1:08 PM - Michael: And yeah crazy can happen to anyone
10/28/21, 1:09 PM - Andres Perez: My fit Finnish wife as well suffers the same
10/28/21, 1:09 PM - Michael: Really, panic attacks?
10/28/21, 1:10 PM - Andres Perez: https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIDR5jlcQ7/
10/28/21, 1:15 PM - Andres Perez: So you haven't felt like getting beers or anything?
10/28/21, 1:15 PM - Michael: Nope, because i got a full blown panic attack in thr morning after beers
10/28/21, 1:16 PM - Andres Perez: Yeah, it's what I read, that alcohol doesn't help at all
10/28/21, 1:16 PM - Andres Perez: Or maybe you didn't get wasted enough 😅
11/8/21, 7:10 PM - Andres Perez: Bro, how are you feeling?
11/8/21, 7:10 PM - Michael: Slowly better. But slowly
11/8/21, 7:12 PM - Michael: No more strong anxiety but breathing problems and stuff like that that makes it uncomfortable but its ok.
11/8/21, 7:40 PM - Andres Perez: Better slowly than never 🙃

4/17/23, 9:19 AM - Andres Perez: It's a long shot, but still worth a shot.

This Saturday I am doing an olympic triathlon,
1.5 swimming, 40 cycling and 10 running.
The problem is that I still don't have the bike.
I checked with my company and I can buy it and then they will reimburse me the money when I send the invoice (2 days). And then, they will deduct it in a few months from my gross salary. The advantage, is that it is taxes free through the company, so I'd pay around 65% of the original price in a few months.
As I said, these few last months I have sent a lot of money to Mexico for the flat and the land in playa del Carmen. So, I'm quite tight right now...
If you can't it's completely fine bro, but wondering if I could borrow around 1450 eur, but the bike and pay you back in around 2 days...
This is the bike.
https://www.decathlon.nl/p/racefiets-wielrenfiets-edr-af-ultegra/_/R-p-311959
4/17/23, 9:38 AM - Michael: 1450
4/17/23, 9:38 AM - Michael: Uff
4/17/23, 9:38 AM - Michael: I dont have that kind of cash only credit card
4/17/23, 9:38 AM - Michael: If you pay me back in 2 days can pay with my credit card
4/17/23, 9:39 AM - Michael: Everything is invested
4/17/23, 9:39 AM - Michael: Ill get my salary on 20th
4/17/23, 9:40 AM - Michael: Then i can borrow that money for a few days
4/17/23, 9:53 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah, i know it's quite some money...
The thing is that probably the invoice has to be in my name since I'll get reimbursed... Using Wise you could send me the money using the credit card, but only if you feel comfortable and you don't need the cash in 2 days or so
4/17/23, 9:55 AM - Michael: You dont have a credit card?
4/17/23, 9:56 AM - Andres Perez: I had a limit of 2.5k, but I sent around 7.5k to Mexico in the last 3 months. So I had to use it haha
4/17/23, 9:56 AM - Michael: Because for my account it charges me for transferring money
4/17/23, 9:56 AM - Michael: From credit
4/17/23, 9:56 AM - Michael: At least i was able to increase it directly online within a dau
4/17/23, 9:57 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah, no worries then :) I might order it when I get my salary
4/17/23, 9:58 AM - Andres Perez: Oh yeah, I'll check that
4/17/23, 10:00 AM - Michael: I mean if you really need but ive never transferred from the credit since it costs me money but just let me know if you really need it and there is no other way ill send you just pay back any extra charge ill havr
4/17/23, 10:04 AM - Andres Perez: Usually I use this app/website, it charges with the credit card like 4 euros more. And of course I'd pay any extra charge you might have... Let you know later today.

The thing is I want to do this olimpic triathlon just get a feeling of how is my condition and adapt my training... 

Hey, I use Wise to send money abroad. Really easy and a lot cheaper than the bank! Give it a try with a fee-free transfer of up to 150,000 HUF.

4/17/23, 10:09 AM - Andres Perez: Actually, i just checked and that bike is not available anymore 😅. I think I'll borrow a bike for this Saturday and order mine next week.
Thanks anyways bro
4/17/23, 10:26 AM - Michael: 👌🏼
4/17/23, 10:26 AM - Michael: Would of easily sent that but i try to keep as little cash as possible so i have that kind of money on my account only right after my salary
4/17/23, 10:27 AM - Andres Perez: Yeah bro, no worries at all. Same, i get it Thanks anyways 🙏
4/17/23, 10:28 AM - Andres Perez: Being sportive is more expensive than alcoholic haha
